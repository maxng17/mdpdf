# Contributing to MDPDF

Thanks for contributing to MDPDF, we try to make it as simple as possible to contribute and we accept contributions in a variety of different ways.

Before starting, please familiarise yourself with the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This code of conduct is enforced across all mediums used to maintain mdpdf including github, mailing lists, forums, irc channels, etc.

Contributions are preferred over GitHub for the easier of the maintainer, but they can also be submitted by email to those listed as maintainers in the [package.json](./package.json) if you prefer.

## Bug reports

When submitting bug reports, please provide as much detail as possible and ensure you follow any issue templates. It is more likely that your issue will be investigated and fixed if you include:

* The OS you're using
* The version of nodejs, and mdpdf
* Clear and _complete_ reproduction steps, including code samples

## Fixes, features, and code

Before getting started with your feature, fix, or code it's a good idea to ensure there is an issue open for what you're about to do. This ensures we can track discussion, and reduce the chance of wasting anyone's effort.

When raising a pull request, or emailing a patch, please include reference to the issue you're addressing. Please also include a good description of the changes you have made, along with any other supporting information you believe may be useful to a reviewer.
